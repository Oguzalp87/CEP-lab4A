# Pasta and Steak

## Ingredients
- Pasta (your choice)  
- 2 medium steaks  
- 2 table spoone olive oil  
- 3 cloves garlic, minced  
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved  
- half cup grated Parmesan cheese  
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)  
- Salt and black pepper  

## Cooking Steps
1. Boil water in a pot, add salt, and cook pasta until al dente. Drain and set aside.  
2. Season steaks generously with salt and pepper.  
3. Heat a skillet with olive oil on high heat. Sear steaks **3–4 minutes per side** (for medium-rare) or adjust for your preference.  
4. Remove steaks from the skillet and let them **rest for 5 minutes** before slicing.  
5. In the same skillet, sauté garlic and cherry tomatoes until softened.  
6. Add the cooked pasta to the skillet, tossing with the tomato mixture.  
7. Plate pasta, then top with sliced steak. Sprinkle with Parmesan and parsley.  

**Tip:** Always let the steak **rest before slicing** to keep it juicy and flavorful.
